Download weather for turret

Potential trial to mimic SARDI fungicide trial in 2018.
[Description of the trial at GRDC publications](https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/grdc-update-papers/tab-content/grdc-update-papers/2019/02/ascochyta-blight-in-intensive-cropping-of-pulses)

Lets see if we can download the weather data for this area
```{r}
met_stat <- as.data.table(get_station_metadata())

turret_deets <- met_stat[name == "TURRETFIELD RESEARCH CENTRE"]
turret_dat <- 
  get_met_data(station_id = turret_deets$id,
               years = 2018,
               full_data = TRUE)

setDT(turret_dat)
turret_dat
```
Turretfield research station does not return data for 2018, we will try the next nearest stations

```{r}
met_stat[lat < -34.4 &
            lat > -34.8 &
            lon > 138.6 & 
            lon < 139]
```
